  "biography": "At this moment, J-C is an undergraduate Quantitative Finance Major at the Stevens Institute of Technology, living in Hoboken NJ. However, in an attempt to intrigue the reader (and not bore them while grading some large number of these assignments) he has crafted the following: \n Some 13.8 billion years (+/-59 million years) after a momentos explosion of matter, the forces of nature so happened to produce a self-aware organism who was given the name John-Craig Borman (or J-C for short). During the 21 years of his existence on Earth, he has found himself traveling and living across the expanses of both North America and Europe. Along the way J-C has preoccupied himself with a fascination for learning and experiencing the world, from building outdoorsman skills to reading up on (and living through) existential crises. He also fancies an interest in highly obscure and abstract mathematics, often wondering \"[h]ow do these symbols actually even mean anything at all?\"",
